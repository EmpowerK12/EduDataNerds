1. Organize the queries by SIS or data system.  To put a file in a folder (or to move the file), just name or rename the file [Folder Name]/[File Name]
2. Comment your code so that another community member can use it in their own context.  The general steps should be clear and the user should not have to guess about where joins remain unique or introduce multiple rows.
